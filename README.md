# tomogotchi-inspired-game
A Java command-line-based game about managing a digital pet by balancing three attributes.

You have three stats: food, medicine, and happiness. You type eat, drug, or play respectively to choose which one you give points to. If any of them reach below 0, your Tomo dies and you lose. 
If medicine goes above 7, your Tomo overdoses and dies, which is also a lose state. The goal of the game is to keep your pet alive for as long as possible.

These stats are controlled by a randomizer that uses logic to update these stats negatively every time there is input. I've been tinkering back and forth on how to balance these 
stats, but  with no actual feedback other than my own, I wanted to upload this here to see what others make of it. Everything is sort of self-explanatory.

To play the game, you must compile then run the program in a terminal.
